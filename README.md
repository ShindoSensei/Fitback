# Pulse

"Safety in your fingertips"

Pulse is an IOT-Web app that reads the real time heart rates of a group of people. It notifies the user if any person's heart rate has breached a safety threshold during a physical training session.

Target users are instructors of institutions such as the military, police force or civil defence force.
